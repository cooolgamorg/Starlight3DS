*Nintendo 3DS "Custom Firmware"*

**Please check the [Official Luma3DS readme](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS) for more info!**

## What it is
**Starlight3DS** is an unofficial fork of [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS) with more features, this is a continuation of [DullPointer's luma fork](https://github.com/DullPointer/Luma3DS) where most features are taken from it and made compatible for the latest Luma3DS version at the time of writing this.

There's also some features taken from other luma forks as well and some that I added myself. **Please check the [credits](https://github.com/cooolgamorg/Starlight3DS?tab=readme-ov-file#credits) to see people who made this fork possible!**

Starlight3DS requires a full-system persisent exploit such as [boot9strap](https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap) to run.

## Changes with the official build
Note: The config file is different from the original luma3DS, it's "configplus.ini" instead of "config.ini" to avoid conflicts if you want to switch between this modified version and the official one (like for playing CTGP-7 for example).

- Changed auto-copy to ctrnand and essential backup checks to be less annoying
- Restored UNITINFO and enable rosalina on safe_firm options on the luma config menu (TWL patch option is now with "enable external firms and modules")
- Removed the need of having both "Game Patching" and "External Firms and Modules" enabled for patching sysmodules, just "External Firms and Modules" need to be enabled
- Added shortcuts:
  - Press start + select to toggle bottom screen (nice when you watch videos) inspired by [This](https://github.com/DullPointer/Luma3DS/commit/9fea831656446cbaa2b5b4f6364407bb1b35dee7)
  - Press A + B + X + Y + Start to instantly reboot the console. Useful in case of freeze, but can potentially corrupt your sdcard. This is why this option is now hidden in the `config.ini` file
  - Press Start on Rosalina menu to toggle wifi -> [Original](https://github.com/DullPointer/Luma3DS/commit/c1a20558bed3d792d54069719a898006af20ba85)
  - Press Select on Rosalina menu to toggle LEDs -> [Original](https://github.com/DullPointer/Luma3DS/commit/fa70d374c00e39dee8b9ef54f60deb1da35a0c51) (and press Y to force blue led as a workaround when the battery is low)
- Added [Extra Config menu](https://github.com/DullPointer/Luma3DS/commit/174ed486ab59bd249488c9035682fa7d058d1e80) including:
  - Automatically suppress LEDs
  - Cut power to TWL Flashcards allowing to save battery
  - Home button opens Rosalina
  - start + select shortcut to toggle top/bottom screen (enabled on bottom screen by default)
- Added Day and Night mode (lite):
  - You can choose the screen brightness
  - You can choose to turn on or off the LEDs
  - Those will be applied at a desired time
- Added n3ds clock + L2 status in rosalina menu -> [Original](https://github.com/DullPointer/Luma3DS/commit/2dbfa8b5c9b719b7f3056691f54332f42da6de8d)
- Added Software Volume Control -> (now merged with the official luma3ds one)
- Added per-screen brightness -> [Original](https://github.com/DullPointer/Luma3DS/commit/83e8d471a377bc6960fae00d6694f5fe86dcca42)
- Added permanent brightness calibration -> [Original](https://github.com/DullPointer/Luma3DS/commit/0e67a667077f601680f74ddc10ef88a799a5a7ad)
- Added a option to cut wifi while in sleep mode allowing to save battery -> [Original](https://github.com/DullPointer/Luma3DS/commit/174ed486ab59bd249488c9035682fa7d058d1e80)
- Added the ability to redirect layeredFS path -> [Original](https://github.com/DeathChaos25/Luma3DS/commit/8f68d0a19d2ed80fb41bbe8499cb2b7b027e8a8c)
- Added loading of custom logo while launching a app from luma/logo.bin -> [Original](https://github.com/Pixel-Pop/Luma3DS/commit/d225d9fa507dcccce3a6c86d0a38f7998f39b7a2)
- Added loading of external decrypted otp from luma/otp.bin -> [Original](https://github.com/truedread/Luma3DS/commit/aa395a5910113b991e6ad7edc3415152be9bbb03#diff-ef6e6ba78a0250ac4b86068018f17d423fe816bb00fb3b550725f1cb6f983d29)
- Changed colors on config menu because why not
- Continue running after a errdisp error happens, this is the same option as instant reboot because they kinda go together (you decide when to reboot after an error occur)
- Added play coin maximize to rosalina menu -> [Original](https://github.com/Gruetzig/Luma3DS/commit/1e329b55dade61ba74a0bb1cc6e59d2504d0bde1)
- Plugin Selector -> [Original](https://github.com/Tekito-256/Luma3DS)
  - You can set a plugin to be automatically loaded by default. If a default is set, hold Select while lauinching a game to open the plugin selector menu

## Known issues

**Official Luma3DS issues:**

* **Cheat engine crashes with some applications, in particular Pokémon games**: there is a race condition in Nintendo's `Kernel11` pertaining to attaching a new `KDebugThread` to a `KThread` on thread creation, and another thread null-dereferencing `thread->debugThread`. This causes the cheat engine to crashes games that create and destroy many threads all the time (like Pokémon).
    * For these games, having a **dedicated "game plugin"** is the only alternative until `Kernel11` is reimplemented.
* **Applications reacting to Rosalina menu button combo**: Rosalina merely polls button input at an interval to know when to show the menu. This means that the Rosalina menu combo can sometimes be processed by the game/process that is going to be paused.
    * You can **change the menu combo** in the "Miscellaneous options" submenu (then save it with "Save settings" in the main menu) to work around this.

**Starlight3DS issues:**

* **Top screen doesn't use the boundaries correctly in the change screen brightness menu (n3ds with IPS screens)**: This may be caused by IPS screens on new 3ds, I tested it on my own and it seems safe so far, but it *may* break and set the brightness very high, DO NOT use this and report this issue if this happens!

## Building from source

To build StarLight3DS, the following is needed:
* git
* [makerom](https://github.com/jakcron/Project_CTR) in `$PATH`
* [firmtool](https://github.com/TuxSH/firmtool) installed
* up-to-date devkitARM and libctru:
    * install `dkp-pacman` (or, for distributions that already provide pacman, add repositories): https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitPro_pacman
    * install packages from `3ds-dev` metapackage: `sudo dkp-pacman -S 3ds-dev --needed`
    * while libctru and StarLight3DS releases are kept in sync, you may have to build libctru from source for non-release StarLight3DS commits

While StarLight3DS releases are bundled with `3ds-hbmenu`, StarLight3DS actually compiles into one single file: `boot.firm`. Just copy it over to the root of your SD card ([ftpd](https://github.com/mtheall/ftpd) is the easiest way to do so), and you're done.
